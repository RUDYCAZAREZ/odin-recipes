    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Honey walnut shrimp seems like it is really popular in the United States. At first I thought it was a really Americanized dish.</p>

    <p>Though it is always really good so I keep ordering it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup walnuts</li>
        <li>4 large egg whites</li>
        <li>2/3 cup mochiko</li>
        <li>1 pound of large shrimp</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons of honey</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together water and sugar in a small saucepan over high heat. Bring to boil and add walnuts. Boil for 2 minutes, then drain and place walnuts on a cookie sheet to dry.</li>
