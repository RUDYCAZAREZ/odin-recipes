    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There will be places selling pizza in almost every major city in the world. Though this pizza is very simple and just has a really good cheese melted on it</p>

    <p>It is a little parmesan and a lot of mozzarella</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
        <li>1 clove of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound of prepared pizza dough</li>
        <li>8 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then stir in cream. Add 2/3 cup of parmesan
            cheese, stir until smooth. Let alfredo sauce cool to room temperature for about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide pizza dough in half. Shape each portion of dough into an 8 to 10 inch disc. Reduce the flame
            om half the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.
        </li>
        <li>Place dough onto the grill and close the cover. Let dough grill until bottom is barely cooked and shows char marks.</li>
        <li>Move pizza to indirect heat. Spoon Alfredo sauce over dough. Top the pizza with four slices of mozzarella cheese and sprinkle parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Grill until the cheese is melted.</li>
